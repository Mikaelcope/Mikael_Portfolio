# Mikael_Portfolio
A portfolio to showcase my past work to potential employers.

## Discription
I have created a url that willl showcase my capabilities using HTML and CSS. I will include projects that I have, in the meantime I will create links to other URLs as I do not have projects to fill my page. I will expand on this work the further into web development I dive and the more skills and knowledge I gain. 

### Installation
Click on the following link to access the URL:
https://mikaelcope.github.io/Mikael_Portfolio/


### Usage
Once the URL has loaded this is what you will see:

The previous work display images will take you to the corresponding links.

### Credits
